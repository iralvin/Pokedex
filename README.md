# Pokedex App

Utilizing the API found at https://pokeapi.co/, this webpage was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. You can select through each of the different generations of Pokemon and the main list will update with all of the Pokemon from that generation. Clicking on a Pokemon will create a makeshift Pokemon card with a random description as well as 2 random attacks it can learn.

More features to add:
- more information re: type/element
- different color card to represent type/element
